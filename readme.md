**Neuroevolution game assignment.**  
**Fall 2021 - Computer Intelligence instructed by [Dr.Mohammad-Mehdi Ebadzadeh](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2130/MOHAMMAD-MEHDI-EBADZADEH?slc_lang=en&&cv=2130&mod=scv).**  

It uses ANN and genetic algorithm in a snail jumper game. It starts with 300 players and they converge and learn to do better in the next generations.
